When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

        When I'm working with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git auto-
matically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

        Because, somebody else might be making new commits to a branch and I
        maybe not interested in pulling it in a specific time. Maybe later
        would me better to pull the files he has created or updated.

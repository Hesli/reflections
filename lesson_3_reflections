When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

        When I'm working with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git auto-
matically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

        Because, somebody else might be making new commits to a branch and I
        maybe not interested in pulling it in a specific time. Maybe later
        would me better to pull the files he has created or updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

        Branch: I would use branch when I want to make some big updates, but
        not sure of the outcome is better to work in a new branch and don't mess
        with the master branch.

        Clone: When I want to work locally in a repo that is in Github, this way
        I basically copy to local and can push and pull changes to the file in
        Github. It's perfect.

        Fork: It's used when I want to contribute to a project or make my own
        version of it. It's kinda like a copy, but different to clone the files
        will be treated as separate ones and I will not push or pull changes to
        the original in Github, but I can do that to my own copy.

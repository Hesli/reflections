What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

        Git create a repository called .git to keep track of the files in the
        current directory. I need to do it to be able to create commits for
        my current project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

        I believe the staging are is an intermediate place between the working
        directory and the repository. But I still don't understand very much
        the differences between them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

        Once I make a change to a file, I can run git status to see which files
        have been changed. If I run "git diff" I'll be able to see the differen-
        ces between the files in the Staging area and the Working Directory. In
        this way, I can make sure I'll commit the right changes.
